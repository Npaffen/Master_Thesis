id | Strava ID of the athlete.
date | Date of the Strava activity
distance | Distance of the training session in km.
mov_time | The moving time feature on Strava is used for all activities that don't depend on fair competition (races and segments). We calculate moving time in two ways. Eithe the athlete adds pause times manually pressing a button on the device or Strava recognizes a pause given some moving threshold. The latter is not defined for cycling activities.
elevation | Amount of meters of the route which contains elevation.
relativeEffort | Intensity across sport types. A Strava specific metric which tells the athlethe how intense his activity (training) was compared other sports activities.
avg_power_weig | Adjusted avg. power of the ride where a Strava algorithm corrects possible outliers in the data due to environmental impacts such as terrain, grade, wind and other factors.
work_total | The sum of watts generated during the rid, expressed in kilojoules(kJ).
training_load | Indicator for how long an athlete should rest after an activity. Power of a ride is compared to an individual functional threshold power. The latter is defined as the highest power output a road cyclist can preserve in a semisteady state for approximately 60 minutes. \cite{Borszcz2018}
intensity | An indicator to express the level of difficulty of a ride compared to the functional threshhold power. E.g. if the weigh. avg. power was 250W and your FTP 300W the intensity would be 83%. For short and intensive rides such as sprints values greater than 100% are possible
estAvgPower | Another estimate of the avg power of an activity generated by Strava. No further information about the calculation was found.
avg_speed | Average speed of the ride.
max_speed | Max speed of the ride.
avg_cadence | Average pedalling rate, average number of revolutions of the crank during the activity.
max_cadence | Max pedalling rate, maximal number of revolutions of the crank during the activity.
avg_hearRate | Average heart rate during the ride.
max_heartRate | Max heart rate during the ride.
avg_power | Average power in watt generated during the ride.
max_power | Max power in watt generated during the ride.
avg_calories | Average calories burned during the ride.
avg_temperature | Average temperature during the ride.
avg_elap_time | Average  elapsed time during the ride.
Energy Output | An indicator for the amount of work an athlete has done during a ride expressed in kilojoules(KJ). Mixture of how fast, how much  and with how much force an athlete is pedaling.
bicycle_computer_model | Model of the bicycle computer.
